### BUILD preparation

1. Read `- Plan:` from `activeContext.md ## References`.
2. If plan path is not `N/A`, `Read(...)` the plan file before creating tasks.
3. Run `plan_trust_gate` before BUILD:
   - `Open Decisions` must be empty or explicitly marked approved.
   - `Differences from agreement` must be present, even if empty.
   - `plan_mode` must be explicit when a plan artifact exists.
   - `verification_rigor` must be explicit when a plan artifact exists.
   - If `plan_mode` is `execution_plan` or `decision_rfc`: every phase in `normalized_phases` must carry non-empty `exit_criteria`, and `intent.acceptance_criteria` must be non-empty. Field presence is not enough — field completeness is required.
   - Cross-check `intent.constraints` against approved decisions. If any approved decision explicitly contradicts an `intent.constraint`, emit NOGO with the contradiction and ask the user to resolve before BUILD starts.
   - If any condition fails, ask for clarification and do not start BUILD.
4. If plan path is `N/A`, assess scope before dispatch:
   - **Trivial** (single concern, one file group, one failure mode) → continue directly to BUILD.
     Heuristic signals: touches 1-2 files, single logical change, one testable outcome, no cross-module wiring.
     [EASY TO MISS: When the task is clearly trivial, do not ask clarifying questions or suggest planning. Execute directly. Analysis paralysis on trivial work is a net negative.]
   - **Non-trivial** (spans multiple independent file groups, has separable concerns, or involves distinct failure modes) → ask: `Plan first (Recommended)` or `Build directly`.
     Heuristic signals: touches 3+ files across different directories, multiple independent concerns that could fail separately, changes to both interface and implementation, or new cross-module dependencies.
   - `Plan first` -> switch to PLAN workflow.
   - `Build directly` -> continue without a plan.
5. If the referenced plan file is missing:
   - Ask: `Build without plan` or `Re-plan first (Recommended)`.
   - `Build without plan` -> continue with `plan:N/A`
   - `Re-plan first` -> switch to PLAN workflow
6. Normalize planner phases into executable `normalized_phases` and initialize `phase_cursor` to the first incomplete phase.
7. Persist the approved `plan_mode` and `verification_rigor` from the planner contract into the workflow artifact.
8. Every normalized phase must carry:
   - `objective`
   - `inputs`
   - `files/surfaces`
   - `expected_artifacts`
   - `required_checks`
   - `checkpoint_type`
   - `exit_criteria`
9. Initialize workflow `proof_status` to `gaps_found` until the current phase is independently verified.
10. Clarify missing requirements before builder only when the plan and memory do not already answer them.
11. Persist pre-answered clarifications in `activeContext.md ## Decisions` using `Build clarification [{topic}]: {answer}`.
12. Builder may execute only the phase at `phase_cursor`.

### BUILD task graph

BUILD is sequential in v10:
- one approved executable phase at a time
- one builder run for the current phase only
- review, hunt, and verify validate that phase before `phase_cursor` advances
- if phase exit evidence is incomplete, record `partial` or `blocked`, persist state, and stop
