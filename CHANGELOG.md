# Changelog

## [6.0.33] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed (Critical)
- F1: Re-Review Loop now spawns a NEW integration-verifier task after each REM-FIX — completed tasks cannot be re-activated via addBlockedBy; Memory Update also blocked on new re-verifier
- F2: Removed duplicate REM-FIX TaskCreate from integration-verifier.md — router rule 1a is sole authority for REM-FIX creation

### Fixed (Medium/Low)
- F3: Added research loop cap (count >= 2) to rule 0c re-invocation — prevents infinite external research loops
- F5: memory_task_id fallback now uses wf: scope from activeContext.md ## References when available
- F7: Removed github-research from SKILL_HINTS prose note at line 439 (H-2 residual)
- F8: Added REM-EVIDENCE loop cap (count >= 1) — enforces "re-invoke once" description
- F4: Added timeout 60s guidance for test execution in component-builder

## [6.0.32] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed
- C-1: Rule 1a now excludes integration-verifier FAIL with CHOSEN_OPTION B/C — options now reachable via rule 2d
- C-2: Added NEEDS_EXTERNAL_RESEARCH and RESEARCH_REASON fields to bug-investigator Router Contract YAML schema
- C-3: Cycle Cap now counts completed REM-FIX tasks (not active) — correctly detects recurring fix loops
- H-1: session-memory Dynamic Skill Discovery template uses [full-skill-id] — prevents cross-namespace corruption
- H-2: Unified github-research routing (removed from SKILL_HINTS Source 1 — router-executed only)
- H-3: Workflow-Final Memory Persistence section now reads from task description (step 3a), not conversation history
- L-2: Removed spurious "Recent Changes: REPLACE" from REVIEW Memory Update (REVIEW makes no code changes)

### Documentation
- M-1: Documented memory_task_id exception to session-memory NEVER policy
- M-2: Removed context:fork from Bible agent frontmatter examples (never valid for agents)
- M-3: Added description field to Bible's TaskUpdate field list

## [6.0.31] - 2026-02-28

### Summary

Task hygiene release. **Principle: tasks are execution artifacts, not parking lots.** Three design fixes across `cc10x-router/SKILL.md` + 5 agent files. Also cleaned up 5 lingering TODO tasks from prior sessions.

### Fixed

- **Re-review task subjects were identical across cycles — looked like a bug** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, Re-Review Loop steps 1-2)
  - Every REM-FIX cycle created identical `"CC10X code-reviewer: Re-review after remediation"` tasks, which looked like infinite looping
  - Fix: Steps 1-2 now extract `completed_remfix_title` from the completed REM-FIX subject and include it: `"CC10X code-reviewer: Re-review — {completed_remfix_title}"`

- **Agents created CC10X TODO tasks for non-blocking findings — tasks hung indefinitely** (all 5 agents)
  - TODO tasks had no owner, no timeline, no next action — just accumulated and polluted TaskList
  - Fix: All agents now write MEDIUM/deferred findings to Memory Notes `**Deferred:**` section instead of calling `TaskCreate`
  - Memory Update task (BUILD/DEBUG/REVIEW) writes `[Deferred]:` entries to `patterns.md ## Common Gotchas` automatically
  - No TODO tasks ever created by agents again

- **TODO Task Handling asked user what to do with TODO tasks — enabling infinite accumulation** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`)
  - "Keep for later" option let TODO tasks persist across sessions forever
  - Fix: Replaced "TODO Task Handling" section with "Deferred Findings Cleanup" — auto-writes any remaining `CC10X TODO:` tasks to `patterns.md` then deletes them. No user prompt.

- **Rule 1b "Proceed anyway" created a CC10X TODO task for skipped HIGH issues** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, rule 1b)
  - We added this in v6.0.30, but it was the wrong mechanism
  - Fix: Now writes `[Skipped HIGH — {agent}]: ...` directly to `patterns.md ## Common Gotchas` via Edit. No task created.

### Changed

- `cc10x-router/SKILL.md` — Re-Review Loop (steps 1-2), Deferred Findings Cleanup (replaces TODO Task Handling), rule 1b, all 3 Memory Update task descriptions (BUILD/DEBUG/REVIEW)
- `code-reviewer.md` — CC10X TODO TaskCreate removed; `**Deferred:**` added to Memory Notes template
- `silent-failure-hunter.md` — same
- `component-builder.md` — same (non-blocking findings go to Findings section + Memory Notes)
- `bug-investigator.md` — same
- `integration-verifier.md` — verification-failure task changed from `CC10X TODO: Fix verification failure` to `CC10X REM-FIX: Fix verification failure` (it's an actual fix task that should trigger the Re-Review Loop)

### Notes

- 5 existing TODO tasks from prior sessions (#14, #15, #31, #32, #33) were written to patterns.md and deleted as part of this release
- Verifier found 7/7 scenarios PASS — source and 6.0.31 cache identical, all v6.0.30 changes intact
- Hunter found 3 MEDIUM issues — they were placed in `**Deferred:**` Memory Notes (demonstrating the new system immediately, no TODO tasks created)
- Small deferred items for future cleanup: re-review subject double-agent-name cosmetic issue, `[Deferred]:` label standardization, patterns.md Common Gotchas pruning rule

## [6.0.30] - 2026-02-28

### Summary

Targeted fixes release. **28 changes** to `cc10x-router/SKILL.md` only — no agent files touched. All from an external audit validated against actual 6.0.29 source (1 false claim identified and rejected). Built using cc10x on cc10x (dogfood session). 2 REM-FIX cycles caught and fixed operator precedence + null guard issues introduced by the initial build pass.

### Fixed

- **Re-Review Cycle Cap used `status=completed` — same cross-session contamination as old Circuit Breaker** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, Re-Review Loop step 0)
  - Same root cause fixed in Circuit Breaker for v6.0.29 was missed in the Cycle Cap
  - Fix: Changed `status=completed` to `status IN [pending, in_progress]` — consistent with Circuit Breaker pattern

- **Rule 0 vs Rule 0c conflict when NEEDS_EXTERNAL_RESEARCH=true AND TDD evidence missing simultaneously** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, Rule 0 table)
  - Rule 0 would override STATUS to BLOCKED (no TDD evidence) before Rule 0c could execute research
  - Fix: Added `AND contract.NEEDS_EXTERNAL_RESEARCH != true` skip condition to bug-investigator row with correct parenthesization: `(TDD_RED_EXIT≠1 OR TDD_GREEN_EXIT≠0 OR VARIANTS_COVERED<1) AND contract.NEEDS_EXTERNAL_RESEARCH != true`

- **Planner clarifications from PLAN workflow not injected into BUILD** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, BUILD step 3)
  - PLAN step 5a collected user answers and persisted to `## Decisions`, but BUILD step 3 never re-read them
  - Fix: BUILD step 3 now checks `## Decisions` for `"Planner clarification ["` entries as pre-answered requirements before AskUserQuestion

- **Re-Review Loop spawns silent-failure-hunter in DEBUG workflows** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, Re-Review Loop step 2)
  - DEBUG chain has no hunter — spawning one after REM-FIX in DEBUG pollutes the workflow
  - Fix: Step 2 now checks if parent task contains `"CC10X DEBUG:"` and skips hunter creation + adjusts verifier blocking

- **REM-EVIDENCE tasks had no agent routing in Chain Execution Loop** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, step 2)
  - `CC10X REM-FIX:` tasks had explicit agent routing but `CC10X REM-EVIDENCE:` tasks had none
  - Fix: Added routing bullet — extracts agent name from subject suffix and re-invokes that agent

- **Re-Review Loop step 6 was dead code** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, Re-Review Loop step 6)
  - Rule 1a already blocks all downstream tasks when creating REM-FIX. Step 6 duplicated this.
  - Fix: Removed step 6, folded into step 5 note

- **memory_task_id stored in `## Learnings` — subject to eviction at >20 entries** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`)
  - `[cc10x-internal]` entry would eventually be evicted by the Learnings freshness rule
  - Fix: Moved storage to `## References` (never pruned); updated resume path to read from References

- **REVIEW Memory Update description missing `## Recent Changes: REPLACE` instruction** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, REVIEW workflow tasks)
  - BUILD and DEBUG had this freshness line; REVIEW did not
  - Fix: Added `activeContext.md ## Recent Changes: REPLACE` to REVIEW Memory Update description

- **`Proceed anyway` on HIGH issues created no follow-up tracking** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, rule 1b)
  - Issues skipped via "Proceed anyway" were only recorded in `## Decisions` — no actionable task created
  - Fix: Added `TaskCreate({ subject: "CC10X TODO: HIGH issues skipped..." })` to the Proceed branch

- **Rule numbering gaps (2a, 2e) had no explanation** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`)
  - Rules jumped: 2 → 2b → 2c → 2f → 2d. Added inline comments explaining 2a is covered by 1b and 2e was moved to rule 0c

- **Step 3a instruction was self-referential** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, Chain Execution Loop)
  - "Immediately after creating the Memory Update task AND after running step 3a..." — circular reference
  - Fix: Rephrased to "At this point, ensure memory_task_id is defined"

- **Workflow-Final Memory section listed 3 READ-ONLY agents regardless of workflow** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`)
  - In DEBUG, silent-failure-hunter was never invoked — memory note search would find nothing
  - Fix: Added "DEBUG workflow note: silent-failure-hunter Memory Notes will not exist — skip"

- **Rule 2 Cases C and D were pure re-dispatch with no net logic** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`)
  - Cases C/D just said "already handled by rule 1b" — created false impression of broader coverage
  - Fix: Simplified rule 2 header to "Only applies when reviewer APPROVE AND hunter found issues (Cases A and B only)" — removed Cases C and D

- **REM-FIX task subjects were opaque** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, rule 1a)
  - `"CC10X REM-FIX: code-reviewer"` — agent name only, no info about what needs fixing
  - Fix: Subject now includes first 60 chars of REMEDIATION_REASON with null guard: `{REMEDIATION_REASON ?? 'see agent output'}`

- **Gate 10 (pkill) ran silently** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, Gates)
  - Test watcher processes killed with no announcement
  - Fix: Announce "Cleaning up orphaned test processes..." and log result before/after kill

- **BUILD Plan-First Gate fired on every new session regardless of request size** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, BUILD step 2)
  - Trivial requests got the same planning prompt as complex architectural work
  - Fix: Added heuristic — requests under 20 words with no cross-layer/security keywords auto-select "Build directly"

- **Mandatory BUILD clarification interrupted explicit requests** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, BUILD step 3)
  - "DO NOT SKIP → AskUserQuestion" fired even when file, function, change, and acceptance criteria all specified
  - Fix: Reordered step 3 — Pre-answers check runs first (reads `## Decisions` for planner clarifications), then ambiguity check gates the AskUserQuestion

- **TODO task handling created N separate questions** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, TODO Task Handling)
  - Multiple TODO tasks = multiple interruptions at workflow end
  - Fix: Batched into one AskUserQuestion: "N TODO items noted — Address all now / Keep all / Review individually"

- **Circuit Breaker and Cycle Cap presented identical question text** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`)
  - Both showed generic messages — no context about which guard fired
  - Fix: Differentiated — CB: "Too many active fix attempts stacking up"; CC: "Multiple active fix cycles unresolved"

- **REM-EVIDENCE tasks were visible in TaskList but marked as if user-actionable** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`)
  - Developers seeing `CC10X REM-EVIDENCE: code-reviewer...` didn't know it's router-internal
  - Fix: Added `[router-internal]` prefix to subject — `"CC10X REM-EVIDENCE: [router-internal] {agent}..."`

- **REM-FIX/TODO task subjects silently produced "null" when REMEDIATION_REASON absent** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, rules 1a/1b/2d)
  - String interpolation `{first N chars of contract.REMEDIATION_REASON}` with no null guard
  - Fix: Added `?? 'see agent output'` guards at rules 1a and 1b; `?? 'see verifier output'` at rule 2d Options B and C

- **C-3 fast-path "skip AskUserQuestion" could skip Pre-answers lookup** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, BUILD step 3)
  - "Proceed directly to step 4" short-circuited the Pre-answers check (core C-3 intent)
  - Fix: Reworded and reordered — Pre-answers now runs first, ambiguity check only gates AskUserQuestion

### Changed

- `plugins/cc10x/skills/cc10x-router/SKILL.md` — 28 surgical changes (20 planned + 8 from 2 REM-FIX cycles)
- No agent files changed

### Notes

- External audit had 1 false claim (H-7: github-research in agent frontmatter — never existed there)
- 6 deferred TODO tasks for v6.0.31: ROOT_CAUSE null guards (×3), rule 1b AskUserQuestion guard, C-3 "cover all gaps" wording, rule 2f research loop cap
- Built dogfood-style: cc10x planned, built, reviewed, and verified this release using itself
- 2 REM-FIX cycles caught operator precedence bug in C-1 (AND-before-OR in CONTRACT RULE) and incomplete null guard sweep (rule 2d missed)

---

## [6.0.29] - 2026-02-28

### Summary

Major orchestration hardening release. **33 surgical changes** across `cc10x-router`, `bug-investigator`, `planner`, `integration-verifier`, and `session-memory`. Fixes every Critical and High issue identified in a comprehensive multi-agent audit run against the system itself (dogfooding). No behavior changes for workflows that work correctly — only incorrect edge cases are fixed.

### Fixed

- **HIGH issues never asked user before proceeding** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, rule 1b)
  - Rule 1b previously treated "if parallel phase AND sibling also REQUIRES_REMEDIATION" as a precondition for AskUserQuestion, not a context-gathering step
  - In serial workflows (REVIEW, single agent), HIGH issues silently fell through to the next agent without asking
  - Fix: Rule 1b now says **"ALWAYS AskUserQuestion — unconditionally, whether serial or parallel phase"**

- **Silent-failure-hunter HIGH conflicts ignored in parallel phase** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, rule 2)
  - Parallel conflict check only fired when `CRITICAL_ISSUES > 0` — hunter HIGH_ISSUES=5 + reviewer APPROVE = no check, no question, proceed
  - Added **Case B**: explicit path for reviewer APPROVE + hunter HIGH_ISSUES > 0 (no CRITICAL)
  - Condition widened from `CRITICAL_ISSUES > 0` to `(CRITICAL_ISSUES > 0 OR HIGH_ISSUES > 0)`

- **Agents could self-report STATUS=PASS/APPROVE while violating their own CONTRACT RULE** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, rule 0)
  - Router only checked `BLOCKING` and `REQUIRES_REMEDIATION` — never verified TDD evidence, scenarios count, or confidence thresholds
  - Added **rule 0: CONTRACT RULE Enforcement** — runs first, auto-overrides STATUS if agent violated its own contract rule (e.g., STATUS=PASS with TDD_RED_EXIT=null)

- **Circuit breaker counted cross-session completed REM-FIX tasks** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, Circuit Breaker)
  - Count was unbounded: prior session REM-FIX tasks (including completed) could trip the breaker on first new fix
  - Fix: count now filters `status IN [pending, in_progress]` only — completed tasks are resolved and ignored

- **Remediation re-review loop had no cycle cap and could deadlock** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, Re-Review Loop)
  - No cap: 3+ re-review cycles could run indefinitely
  - Deadlock: when re-review creates REM-FIX-N, verifier was NOT blocked on REM-FIX-N — Memory Update could run before all fixes complete
  - Added **step 0**: cycle cap — after 2 completed REM-FIX tasks, AskUserQuestion before creating another
  - Added **step 6**: when re-review creates new REM-FIX-N, verifier gets `addBlockedBy: [REM-FIX-N]`

- **QUICK→FULL escalation was silent** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, QUICK mode)
  - User chose QUICK (fast path), verifier failed, router silently escalated to full 4-agent chain
  - Fix: AskUserQuestion before escalating: "Quick verification failed. Run full review chain or abort?"

- **QUICK mode security condition was keyword-only** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, QUICK condition 2)
  - "No security implications" was determined from request text alone — a fix to `auth.ts` described as "minor" would pass
  - Fix: condition 2 now ALSO runs `git diff --name-only HEAD` and fails if changed files match security paths (`auth/`, `crypto/`, `payment/`, etc.)
  - Non-git projects fail condition 2 by default (cannot verify scope)

- **Memory Notes from READ-ONLY agents lost on context compaction** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, step 3a)
  - Memory Notes were only in conversation history — context compaction could erase them before Memory Update task ran
  - Fix: after each READ-ONLY agent completes, router immediately calls `TaskGet → TaskUpdate` to store Memory Notes inside the Memory Update task description (filesystem-backed, survives compaction)
  - Memory Update task now reads its own description instead of conversation history

- **NEEDS_CLARIFICATION (planner) and INVESTIGATING (bug-investigator) routed to wrong agent** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, rules 1a/2b/2c)
  - Both statuses set `BLOCKING=true`, which triggered rule 1a (create REM-FIX → component-builder) before specialized handlers could fire
  - Fix: rule 1a guard now excludes `NEEDS_CLARIFICATION`, `INVESTIGATING`, and `BLOCKED` via NOT IN list
  - Added rule 2b: NEEDS_CLARIFICATION → AskUserQuestion → re-invoke planner with user answers
  - Added rule 2c: INVESTIGATING → create "Continue investigation" task with context from ROOT_CAUSE hint
  - Added rule 2f: BLOCKED (terminal stuck state) → AskUserQuestion with research/fix/abort options

- **Integration verifier rollback options never reached router** (`integration-verifier.md`, `cc10x-router/SKILL.md`)
  - Verifier chose Option A/B/C internally but Router Contract had no field — router always created REM-FIX (Option A)
  - Added `CHOSEN_OPTION: A | B | C` to verifier Router Contract
  - Added rule 2d: router reads CHOSEN_OPTION and presents B/C to user before defaulting to A

- **bug-investigator.md called github-research as a Skill() — contradicting router ownership** (`bug-investigator.md`, `planner.md`)
  - Router clearly states "github-research is router-executed directly — never passed as SKILL_HINTS"
  - Both agents had `Skill(skill="cc10x:github-research")` calls contradicting this
  - Fix: both agents now say "Do NOT call github-research — research is router-managed"
  - Added NEEDS_EXTERNAL_RESEARCH escape hatch: agent signals need via contract field, router handles

- **NEEDS_EXTERNAL_RESEARCH contract field had no router handler** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, rule 0c)
  - Field was documented in bug-investigator but silently discarded by router — escape hatch non-functional
  - Added **rule 0c**: pre-1a preamble check — if `NEEDS_EXTERNAL_RESEARCH=true`, execute THREE-PHASE research and re-invoke bug-investigator. Includes explicit STOP to prevent rules 1a/1b/2 from also firing

- **DEBUG-RESET marker insertion was prose-only — subsequent Debug-N edits silently failed** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, DEBUG counting)
  - "Prepend [DEBUG-RESET: wf:{id}] to ## Recent Changes" was prose, not a concrete Edit call
  - DEBUG-N entries anchor on the marker text — if marker not written, Edits fail silently, 3-attempt research trigger permanently disabled
  - Fix: explicit `Edit(old_string="## Recent Changes", new_string="## Recent Changes\n[DEBUG-RESET: wf:{id}]")` + mandatory Read-verify before any DEBUG-N edits

- **DEBUG-N edit anchor placed entries before the marker, making counter read 0** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`)
  - Both marker insertion and DEBUG-N entries used `## Recent Changes` as anchor — new entries landed BEFORE the marker in file order
  - Counter instruction "count entries AFTER the marker" always read zero — 3-attempt research trigger never fired
  - Fix: DEBUG-N entries now anchor on the marker text itself, placing them after it

- **External research auto-executed without user approval** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, DEBUG step 3)
  - After 3+ failed debug attempts, router auto-called GitHub API and wrote to docs/research/ without asking
  - Fix: AskUserQuestion first: "Research GitHub? (External API calls)" with options: Research / Keep debugging locally / Abort

- **Planner "Your Input Needed" section was never actioned** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, PLAN step 5a)
  - Planner outputs critical assumptions needing validation — but PLAN workflow completed without collecting user answers
  - BUILD started on unvalidated assumptions
  - Added **step 5a**: after planner completes, check for "Your Input Needed" section → AskUserQuestion → persist answers to memory → include in BUILD context

- **memory_task_id lost on context compaction with no recovery path** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, step 3a + resume path)
  - Local variable undefined after compaction — step 3a (Memory Notes capture) silently failed
  - Resume path had no memory_task_id reconstruction step
  - Fix: store raw taskId in `## Learnings` as `[cc10x-internal] memory_task_id: {id} wf:{id}` at creation
  - Resume path now reads taskId from Learnings first (exact lookup, collision-safe), falls back to TaskList subject search

- **INVESTIGATING loop cap counted all historical completions — false triggers in long-lived projects**
  - Loop cap for "Continue investigation" tasks counted `status IN [pending, in_progress, completed]` — 3+ historical successful debugs = always-on cap on new workflows
  - Fix: excluded `completed` from status filter

- **integration-verifier preloaded debugging-patterns (mismatched skill)** (`integration-verifier.md`)
  - Verification agent was loading investigation-phase skill with no applicable patterns
  - Removed `cc10x:debugging-patterns` from frontmatter — verification-before-completion covers the role

- **bug-investigator missing code-generation skill** (`bug-investigator.md`)
  - Agent writes regression tests and fixes but didn't load Universal Questions, minimal-diff, or edge-case patterns
  - Added `cc10x:code-generation` to frontmatter skills

- **Planner NEEDS_CLARIFICATION had no router signal** (`planner.md`)
  - `BLOCKING: false` and `REQUIRES_REMEDIATION: false` always — router proceeded even when planner signaled ambiguity
  - Fix: `BLOCKING: true` and `REQUIRES_REMEDIATION: true` when `STATUS=NEEDS_CLARIFICATION`

- **Task IDs stored as durable references — fragile across session restarts** (`session-memory/SKILL.md`)
  - Session-memory docs warned against this but provided no concrete Hydration Pattern
  - Added explicit **Hydration Pattern** guidance: read progress.md → recreate tasks → sync back

### Changed

- `cc10x-router/SKILL.md` — 33 surgical additions/modifications to validation rules, DEBUG counting, QUICK mode, Memory Notes flow, and PLAN workflow
- `bug-investigator.md` — github-research ownership clarified; `code-generation` added to frontmatter; NEEDS_EXTERNAL_RESEARCH escape hatch documented
- `planner.md` — github-research ownership clarified; NEEDS_CLARIFICATION contract now correctly signals BLOCKING=true
- `integration-verifier.md` — `debugging-patterns` removed from frontmatter; `CHOSEN_OPTION` added to Router Contract
- `session-memory/SKILL.md` — Hydration Pattern added to Task surface description

### Notes

- Discovered via comprehensive multi-agent audit using cc10x to audit cc10x (dogfood session)
- 5 deferred TODO edge cases: [cc10x-internal] eviction exclusion, rule 2f research loop cap, INVESTIGATING loop historical count, planner re-invocation max iterations
- All changes validated by cc10x code-reviewer + silent-failure-hunter + integration-verifier
- The 6.0.28 manifests were not bumped in the 6.0.28 commit — 6.0.29 manifests cover both

---

## [6.0.28] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- **Regression: HIGH issues creating TODO tasks** (`silent-failure-hunter.md`, `code-reviewer.md`)
  - 6.0.26 added REQUIRES_REMEDIATION for HIGH issues, routing them to rule 1b (soft gate)
  - Both agents still had `**If HIGH or MEDIUM issues found**` guard for TODO task creation — HIGH now has a remediation path via rule 1b, so TODO creation is redundant and creates noise
  - Fix: guard now reads `**If MEDIUM issues found**` (hunter) and `**If non-critical, non-HIGH issues**` (reviewer); HIGH issues go through the soft gate only

- **Parallel gate asks user twice** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, rule 1b)
  - When both parallel agents (code-reviewer + silent-failure-hunter) each have REQUIRES_REMEDIATION=true, rule 1b fired once per agent — two separate AskUserQuestion prompts with incomplete info each time
  - Fix: rule 1b now checks if sibling contract also has REQUIRES_REMEDIATION=true and merges both REMEDIATION_REASONs into one consolidated AskUserQuestion

- **REM-FIX tasks have no agent mapping** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, chain loop step 2)
  - CC10X REM-FIX task subjects had no rule mapping them to an agent; the loop template `cc10x:{agent}` had no agent to fill in
  - Fix: step 2 now explicitly maps REM-FIX tasks to cc10x:component-builder (BUILD/REVIEW) or cc10x:bug-investigator (DEBUG)

- **Re-Review Loop can be skipped** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, chain loop step 3)
  - After a REM-FIX task completes, the verifier can become unblocked in TaskList() before the router inserts re-review blockers
  - Fix: step 3 now requires executing the Remediation Re-Review Loop BEFORE finding next runnable tasks when a REM-FIX task completes

- **Circuit Breaker counts cross-workflow REM-FIX tasks** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, Circuit Breaker)
  - Tasks from prior sessions inflated the REM-FIX count and could trip the breaker early
  - Fix: count is now scoped to the current workflow (since the current CC10X BUILD/DEBUG/REVIEW: parent task)

- **REM-EVIDENCE has no actionable retry procedure** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, REM-EVIDENCE)
  - Description said "Re-run agent or manually verify" — no deterministic first step
  - Fix: description now says to re-invoke the same agent once; if still missing, AskUserQuestion

### Changed

- `silent-failure-hunter.md` — TODO gate changed from HIGH+MEDIUM to MEDIUM only
- `code-reviewer.md` — TODO gate changed from non-critical to non-critical/non-HIGH (MEDIUM/MINOR only)
- `cc10x-router/SKILL.md`:
  - Rule 1b: parallel merge for double-REQUIRES_REMEDIATION; "Fix now" path covers `each affected agent`; Decisions log uses `{agent(s)}`
  - Chain loop step 2: explicit REM-FIX→agent mapping bullet
  - Chain loop step 3: ordering note — Remediation Re-Review Loop fires BEFORE next TaskList()
  - Circuit Breaker: scoped to current workflow parent task
  - Post-Agent Validation evidence: added HIGH_ISSUES and REQUIRES_REMEDIATION fields
  - Memory Update descriptions (BUILD/DEBUG/REVIEW): added READ-ONLY-only collection rule, Learnings dedup, and Completed rolling window (10 entries)
  - REM-EVIDENCE description: deterministic re-invoke instruction

### Notes

- All changes are surgical: no existing logic removed, only targeted additions and guard narrowing
- The Re-Review Loop section itself (lines 483-501) is untouched — only an ordering note is added
- `integration-verifier.md` and `planner.md` unchanged (binary PASS/FAIL; planner never hard-blocks by design)

---

## [6.0.27] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- **Persistent SKILL_HINTS across sessions** (`session-memory/SKILL.md`, `code-reviewer.md`, `silent-failure-hunter.md`, `integration-verifier.md`)
  - Domain skills (MongoDB, React, etc.) detected in session 1 were lost in session 2 — router had no way to re-detect from terse follow-on requests like "let's build it"
  - Integration-verifier never received SKILL_HINTS from the router (read-only agents receive memory in prompt, not via session-memory skill)
  - Skills detected during a session were lost on context compaction
  - Root cause: SKILL_HINTS were only passed by the router per-invocation; no persistence mechanism existed; READ-ONLY agents don't load session-memory so adding instructions there wouldn't reach them
  - Fix: agents self-activate from `patterns.md ## Project SKILL_HINTS` — WRITE agents via session-memory Dynamic Skill Discovery, READ-ONLY agents via a one-line addition to their own SKILL_HINTS section
  - Router: zero changes (no bloat added)

### Changed

- `session-memory/SKILL.md` — added `## Project SKILL_HINTS` section to patterns.md template; added to Stable Anchors table; added Dynamic Skill Discovery subsection for WRITE agents
- `code-reviewer.md` — SKILL_HINTS section: also checks patterns.md after memory load
- `silent-failure-hunter.md` — same
- `integration-verifier.md` — same

### Notes

- Closes all 3 SKILL_HINTS gaps: PLAN→BUILD continuity, verifier blind spot, compaction survival
- Append-only design: skills accumulate per project, never overwritten
- Graceful degradation: skill not installed → noted in Memory Notes, continues without it

---

## [6.0.26] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- **Soft gate for HIGH/non-critical issues** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, `code-reviewer.md`, `silent-failure-hunter.md`, `docs/cc10x-orchestration-bible.md`)
  - Router previously ignored HIGH severity issues (BLOCKING=false, REQUIRES_REMEDIATION=false) and proceeded silently
  - User had to manually interrupt and say "go fix those first" — poor UX at the review gate
  - Root cause: `REQUIRES_REMEDIATION` was only set to `true` when `CRITICAL_ISSUES > 0`, so HIGH issues fell through to Rule 4 ("proceed to next agent") with zero user interaction
  - Both agents already output `HIGH_ISSUES` in their Router Contract — the field existed but was unconnected to any decision rule
  - Fix: agents now set `REQUIRES_REMEDIATION=true` when `HIGH_ISSUES > 0`; router Rule 1 split into 1a (hard stop for CRITICAL) and 1b (AskUserQuestion soft gate for HIGH)
  - Rule 1b is compact (4 lines): reads `contract.REMEDIATION_REASON` pre-crafted by the agent, no duplication in router

### Changed

- `code-reviewer.md` — `REQUIRES_REMEDIATION` now includes `HIGH_ISSUES > 0`; `REMEDIATION_REASON` covers HIGH case
- `silent-failure-hunter.md` — same; `CONTRACT RULE` updated: `STATUS=CLEAN requires CRITICAL_ISSUES=0 and HIGH_ISSUES=0`
- `cc10x-router/SKILL.md` — Rule 1 → 1a/1b split; 1b is a 4-line soft gate (no router bloat)
- `docs/cc10x-orchestration-bible.md` — synced to match new rules; last-synced date updated

### Notes

- CRITICAL path (Rule 1a) is byte-for-byte identical to old Rule 1 — no behavior change for critical issues
- HIGH issues now surface as: "Fix high-severity issues: {agent's summary} — fix before continuing?"
- "Proceed anyway" records the decision in `activeContext.md ## Decisions` for audit trail

## [6.0.25] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- **github-research double-trigger: removed from SKILL_HINTS table** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`)
  - Detection table listed `cc10x:github-research` as a SKILL_HINTS candidate for `planner` and `bug-investigator`
  - But PLAN/DEBUG workflows execute github-research directly via THREE-PHASE process ("NOT as a hint")
  - Contradiction: same skill simultaneously marked "pass as SKILL_HINTS" and "execute directly, NOT a hint"
  - In practice: router ran research AND passed github-research in SKILL_HINTS → planner could trigger the skill's user confirmation gate a second time
  - Fixed: deleted the 7-line SKILL_HINTS table (only contained github-research rows) and replaced with one note: `cc10x:github-research is router-executed directly — never passed as SKILL_HINTS`

### Notes

- 7 lines deleted, 1 line added — net -6 lines
- No behavior change for CLAUDE.md complementary skills (unaffected path)
- Router still detects github-research triggers via PLAN/DEBUG workflow sections (unchanged)

---

## [6.0.24] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- **SKILL_HINTS: three latent issues remaining after 6.0.23** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`, `planner.md`, `docs/cc10x-orchestration-logic-analysis.md`)

  - **Chain Execution Loop: abbreviated SKILL_HINTS format** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`)
    - The operational loop template had `SKILL_HINTS: {detected skills}` — no invoke instruction
    - Full Agent Invocation template correctly had `## SKILL_HINTS (INVOKE via Skill() - not optional)`
    - Two inconsistent formats in the same file created ambiguity about whether skills must be invoked
    - Fixed: Loop template now reads `SKILL_HINTS (INVOKE via Skill() - not optional): {detected skills}` — consistent with full template

  - **Planner "Recommended Skills for BUILD" hardcoded one MongoDB skill** (`planner.md`)
    - Example read `MongoDB → mongodb-agent-skills:mongodb-schema-design` — implied only one skill needed
    - Fixed: Now reads `MongoDB → all matching mongodb-agent-skills:* from CLAUDE.md` — points to full set

  - **Analysis doc contradicted the router** (`docs/cc10x-orchestration-logic-analysis.md`)
    - Phase 4 said "Only github-research uses SKILL_HINTS mechanism" — stale since 6.0.18 added Source 2
    - Maintainers reading this doc would assume CLAUDE.md complementary skills don't exist
    - Fixed: Phase 4 now documents both sources — github-research (Source 1) and CLAUDE.md Complementary Skills (Source 2)

### Notes

- ADJACENT risk — no router decision tree, task protocol, agent chain, or memory anchor changes
- 3 files changed, 10 insertions(+), 4 deletions(-)
- All three issues were documentation/template precision bugs, not logic changes

---

## [6.0.23] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- **Restored `## Skill Loading Hierarchy` section deleted in 6.0.22** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`)
  - Section documented the two-source SKILL_HINTS bridge — the ONLY place that explicitly listed:
    - Source 1: Router detection table → `cc10x:github-research`
    - Source 2: CLAUDE.md Complementary Skills table → domain skills (react-best-practices, mongodb-agent-skills, etc.)
  - Without it, Source 2 survived only as a one-line footnote buried after the github-research table — too weak for reliable detection
  - Result: complementary skills were silently dropped from SKILL_HINTS on most workflows
  - All other 6.0.22 changes preserved (Task Dependency Safety compression, TODO compression, pre-spawn announcement)

### Notes

- Net: 663→685 lines (+20, surgical restore of the deleted block only)
- Root cause identified via diff analysis of 6.0.22 commit `de535bf`

---

## [6.0.22] - 2026-02-26

### Changed

- **Router trimmed: removed 45 lines of documentation overhead** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`)
  - Deleted `## Skill Loading Hierarchy` section (19 lines) — architecture explainer for humans, not operational for the router; all SKILL_HINTS behavior is already covered by the detection table and Agent Invocation template
  - Compressed `## Task Dependency Safety` from 13 lines to 2 — the cycle-detection procedure was instructions for a problem the system itself says cannot happen; kept the forward-only rule
  - Compressed `### TODO Task Handling` from 21 lines to 4 — removed the "why" paragraph and verbose numbered steps; behavior is preserved

### Added

- **Pre-spawn announcement** (`cc10x-router/SKILL.md`) — 1-line instruction in Execution Loop Step 2: before spawning any agent, write 1 sentence on what it will do and why it matters now. Improves user visibility and catches misrouting early.

---

## [6.0.21] - 2026-02-23

### Added

- **User Standards support** (`session-memory/SKILL.md` + README) (#13)
  - Added `## User Standards` section to the `patterns.md` template — agents load patterns.md on every workflow, so any standards written there are automatically followed
  - `## User Standards` entries are marked **non-negotiable** in the session-memory skill
  - Setup wizard (Step 4) now asks for user standards and writes them to `.claude/cc10x/patterns.md` on install
  - Closes #13

### Fixed

- **Multi-project setup docs** (README) (#12)
  - Added "Multi-project note" in setup Step 2: global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` activates cc10x in all projects — no per-project reinstall needed
  - Added Troubleshooting section explaining what to do when cc10x doesn't activate in a specific project and the correct plugin reference format
  - Closes #12

- **Linux EXDEV install error docs** (README) (#8)
  - Added Troubleshooting section with `TMPDIR` workaround for cross-device link error on Ubuntu/Linux
  - Added manual git clone fallback for when the installer fails
  - Closes #8

---

## [6.0.20] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- **Agent self-report task completion** (all 6 agents + router SKILL.md)
  - Added `TaskUpdate` to each agent's tool allowlist
  - Agents now call `TaskUpdate(completed)` after their final output
  - Router falls back via `TaskList()` if agent misses it — no regression
  - Closes #14

### Added

- **Optional MCP documentation** (README)
  - New "Optional MCP Integrations" section listing octocode and brightdata
  - Explains what each MCP unlocks and that cc10x works without them
  - Closes #9

### Fixed

- **Memory file permission prompts** (README Step 3)
  - Added `Edit(.claude/cc10x/*)` and `Write(.claude/cc10x/*)` to settings.json template
  - Pre-approves edits to memory files, eliminating repeated permission prompts
  - Closes #7

---

## [6.0.19] - 2026-02-15

### Added

- **Multi-Signal Scoring** (code-reviewer agent + code-review-patterns skill)
  - Review passes now produce per-dimension HARD/SOFT signals (Security, Correctness, Performance, Maintainability, UX)
  - HARD:0 on any dimension = CONFIDENCE:0 regardless of other scores
  - Router can create targeted REM-FIX tasks ("Fix security" not "Fix something")
  - Inspired by Babysitter's `score.md` per-signal rubric

- **Evidence Array Protocol** (verification skill + integration-verifier + component-builder)
  - Every PASS/APPROVE claim must include structured `EVIDENCE:` block
  - Format: `[command] → exit [code]: [result summary]`
  - SCENARIOS_PASSED count must match EVIDENCE entries — mismatch = INVALID
  - Eliminates vibes-based completion claims

- **Decision Checkpoints** (component-builder + planner + bug-investigator)
  - Mandatory AskUserQuestion triggers: >3 files beyond plan, pattern choices, API contract breaks, new dependencies
  - Planner marks `[CHECKPOINT]` decisions in plan output — pre-approved during BUILD
  - Bug-investigator pauses when hypothesis confidence gap <20 between H1/H2

- **Completion Guard** (verification skill + integration-verifier)
  - Final 4-point gate before Router Contract emission: acceptance criteria, evidence array, no stubs, fresh verification
  - Integration-verifier adds pre-completion checklist: scenarios count, orphan processes, stub scan, build check, goal-backward

### Notes

- ADJACENT risk level — no router, task protocol, agent chain, or memory anchor changes
- 7 files changed, 158 insertions, 0 deletions (pure additions)
- Smoke test: 42/42 passed
- All edited files remain under 500-line soft cap
- Inspired by competitive analysis of a5c-ai/babysitter orchestration framework

## [6.0.18] - 2026-02-04

### Added

- **Complementary Skills Handoff** (Router + All 6 Agents)
  - Router now reads CLAUDE.md Complementary Skills table and passes matching skills to agents via SKILL_HINTS
  - All 6 agents now have explicit `## SKILL_HINTS (If Present)` section
  - Agents invoke skills via `Skill(skill="{name}")` after memory load
  - Fixes gap where complementary skills (react-best-practices, mongodb-agent-skills) weren't reaching subagents

### Changed

- Router: +1 line - "Also check CLAUDE.md Complementary Skills table and include matching skills in SKILL_HINTS"
- All agents: +3 lines each - SKILL_HINTS section with invoke instruction

### Notes

- Based on Vercel article: passive context (CLAUDE.md) beats active retrieval
- Router can see CLAUDE.md (runs in main Claude context), subagents cannot
- This bridges the gap: Router reads → passes to agents → agents invoke

## [6.0.17] - 2026-02-04

### Added

- **Planner Clarification Gate** (planner.md)
  - Planner now asks clarifying questions BEFORE planning when requirements are ambiguous
  - Decision table: vague idea → AskUserQuestion, multiple interpretations → AskUserQuestion with options
  - If 3+ questions needed → invokes brainstorming skill for structured discovery

- **Circuit Breaker Research Option** (cc10x-router)
  - When 3+ remediations fail, "Research best practices" is now the recommended first option
  - Triggers `github-research` skill to find external patterns before retrying
  - Options: Research (recommended) / Fix locally / Skip / Abort

### Notes

- ADJACENT risk level (no router decision tree or agent chain changes)
- 2 files changed: planner.md, cc10x-router/SKILL.md
- Fixes gap where AI wouldn't ask clarifying questions

## [6.0.16] - 2026-02-04

### Fixed

- **SKILL_HINTS now MUST be invoked** (Router)
  - Changed: "Load IMMEDIATELY after memory" → "INVOKE via Skill() - not optional"
  - Added explicit instruction: "Call `Skill(skill='{skill-name}')` immediately after memory load"
  - Fixes bug where agents received hints but didn't invoke complementary skills (react-best-practices, mongodb-agent-skills)

- **Plans include Recommended Skills for BUILD** (Planner)
  - Plan output now lists skills component-builder should invoke
  - Example: React/Next.js → `Skill(skill="react-best-practices")`
  - Double safety: Skill invocation in plan + explicit SKILL_HINTS instruction

### Notes

- ADJACENT risk level (no router decision tree, agent chain, or task protocol changes)
- 2 files changed: cc10x-router/SKILL.md, planner.md
- ~8 lines added total
- Version sync: plugin.json, README.md, CHANGELOG.md all aligned to 6.0.16

## [6.0.15] - 2026-02-03

### Added

- **User Confirmation Gate** (github-research)
  - Asks user before any research: "Do you want me to research GitHub and web for this task?"
  - Bypass conditions: User said "research", debug workflow with 3+ failures
  - Prevents unwanted research delays - user controls external calls

- **Parallel Search Chain** (github-research)
  - Tier 1: Octocode + Bright Data execute in SAME message (parallel)
  - Different strengths: Octocode for real code, Bright Data for docs/tutorials
  - Merge strategy: Code patterns from Octocode, context/warnings from Bright Data

- **3-Tier Fallback System** (github-research)
  - Tier 1: Parallel Search (Octocode + Bright Data MCP)
  - Tier 2: Native Claude Code (WebSearch + WebFetch) if MCP unavailable
  - Tier 3: Ask User for Context if all automated sources fail
  - Graceful degradation - never fails silently

- **New Tools Added** (github-research frontmatter)
  - `WebSearch` - Native Claude Code fallback
  - `AskUserQuestion` - User gate + final fallback
  - `mcp__brightdata__search_engine` - Google/Bing search
  - `mcp__brightdata__scrape_as_markdown` - Doc scraping

### Notes

- ADJACENT risk level (skill-only change, no router/agent chain modifications)
- No Bible invariants affected
- User experience improvement: Research happens when user wants it

## [6.0.14] - 2026-02-03

### Changed

- **Simplified Skill Loading** (All 6 Agents + Router + Bible)
  - Moved domain skills (frontend-patterns, architecture-patterns) to agent frontmatter
  - Removed redundant SKILL_HINTS for skills now preloaded via frontmatter
  - Only `github-research` remains conditional via SKILL_HINTS (external API cost)
  - Updated agents: code-reviewer, silent-failure-hunter, integration-verifier (added domain skills)
  - Updated agents: bug-investigator, planner (removed github-research from frontmatter)
  - Updated router: Simplified SKILL_HINTS table to github-research only
  - Updated Bible: 3 sections updated to reflect simplified model

### Rationale

- SKILL_HINTS keyword detection was fragile (could miss patterns)
- Skills are guidance, not commands - irrelevant parts ignored by agent
- One loading mechanism (frontmatter) is simpler than two (frontmatter + hints)
- github-research stays conditional to avoid unnecessary external API calls

### Fixed

- Removed human-oriented version notes from AI instructions (router and Bible)
  - Removed "v6.0.13+" notes and "Simplified Loading" subsection
  - AI instructions should state current facts, not version history

### Notes

- CRITICAL risk level change, but only removes redundancy
- Smoke test: All checks pass
- No Bible invariants affected (skill loading is documented, not invariant)

## [6.0.13] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed

- **FLAW-16: Task Status Update Unreliability** (Router + All 6 Agents)
  - Router now owns task status updates - calls `TaskUpdate(completed)` after agent returns
  - Agents no longer call TaskUpdate for their own task (unreliable in sub-agent context)
  - Based on Claude Code sub-agent research: Task() return is the deterministic handoff point
  - Updated: Router lines 372, 589 + all 6 agent Task Completion sections

- **FLAW-18: Remediation Re-Review Logic in Prose** (Router)
  - Replaced dense paragraphs with pseudocode flowchart
  - AI can execute pseudocode more reliably than prose
  - Updated: Router lines 475-495

### Changed

- **Bible + Logic Analysis docs updated** to reflect new task status ownership
  - Bible: Lines 110, 113, 399
  - Logic Analysis: Lines 235, 493, 509

### Notes

- Both fixes are ADJACENT risk level (no chain/DAG changes)
- 10 flaws remaining (was 12)
- Research: Sub-agents run in isolated context; don't rely on sub-agent bookkeeping

## [6.0.12] - 2026-02-02

### Added

- **LSP Tool Support Expanded** (7 skills, 3 agents)
  - Added LSP to `code-review-patterns`, `debugging-patterns`, `architecture-patterns` (with usage guidance sections)
  - Added LSP to `frontend-patterns`, `code-generation`, `planning-patterns`, `verification-before-completion`
  - All 6 agents already had LSP - now skills guide usage

- **Git Bisect Example** (debugging-patterns)
  - Full step-by-step workflow for "it worked before" scenarios
  - Includes automated bisect with test command

- **architecture-patterns Skill** (component-builder agent)
  - Added to component-builder frontmatter skills for backend work support

### Notes

- All changes are ADJACENT risk level (safe patterns)
- Smoke test: 19/19 passed
- No Bible invariants affected

## [6.0.11] - 2026-02-02

### Fixed

- **FLAW-20: "Active Decisions" Documentation Drift** (session-memory)
  - 11 references to "Active Decisions table" → "Decisions section"
  - Aligns with actual template that uses `## Decisions`

- **FLAW-21: Canonical Sections Documentation Drift** (session-memory + router)
  - Line 361: Old sections (`## Plan Reference`, etc.) → correct sections (`## References`, `## Decisions`)
  - Router: "Research References table" → "References section"
  - Aligns with merged `## References` section in template

### Notes

- Documentation-only fixes (no functional changes)
- Bible already aligned with source of truth (no changes needed)
- Source of truth: `plugins/cc10x/agents/` + `plugins/cc10x/skills/` as harmonized system

## [6.0.10] - 2026-02-02

### Fixed

- **FLAW-15: Plan Reference Section Mismatch** (Router)
  - Router now looks for `## References` + `- Plan:` instead of old `## Plan Reference` format
  - Fixes plan detection that was silently failing

- **FLAW-16: Agent Follow-up Task Naming** (All 5 Agents + Router)
  - All agents now use `CC10X TODO:` prefix for follow-up tasks
  - Router has new TODO handling section (lines 553-571)
  - User gets visibility + control over non-blocking discoveries

- **FLAW-17: Task Owner Check** (Bible)
  - Removed owner check from task availability criteria (CC10x doesn't use owners)

- **FLAW-18: planning-patterns Outdated Anchor** (planning-patterns)
  - Changed `## Active Workflow Tasks` → `## Tasks` to match session-memory template

- **FLAW-19: integration-verifier Non-namespaced Task** (integration-verifier)
  - Added `CC10X TODO:` prefix for verification failure tasks

### Changed

- **Bible Task Types Table** expanded to show ALL task prefixes
- **7 total flaws now fixed** (1, 2, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19)

### Notes

- External AI review validated orchestration - 5/6 claims were real issues
- All functional files, agents, skills, router, and Bible now perfectly aligned
- Zero risk of Edit anchor failures or orphaned tasks

## [6.0.9] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- **Code Review Patterns Enhancement** (308 → 324 lines)
  - **Pattern Recognition Criteria**: 4 criteria for identifying undocumented conventions during reviews (Tribal, Opinionated, Unusual, Consistent)
  - Guidance for documenting discovered patterns in CLAUDE.md or standards

### Notes

- SAFE edit to existing skill (no orchestration impact)
- Improvement extracted from `agent-os` reference audit
- File remains well under 500-line limit (324 lines)
- Follows cc10x-orchestration-safety protocol (edit-only, no new files)

## [6.0.8] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- **Debugging Patterns Enhancement** (436 → 469 lines)
  - **Meta-Debugging: Your Own Code**: Mindset for debugging code you wrote (fighting your own mental model)
  - **When to Restart Investigation**: 5 criteria for starting over (2+ hours stuck, 3+ failed fixes, can't explain behavior, debugging the debugger, fix works but don't know why) plus restart protocol

- **Verification Enhancement** (355 → 398 lines)
  - **Export/Import Verification**: Scripts to check that exports are actually imported AND used (not just imported)
  - **Auth Protection Verification**: Scripts to verify sensitive routes check authentication

### Notes

- All changes are SAFE edits to existing skills (no orchestration impact)
- Improvements extracted from `get-shit-done` reference audit
- All files remain under 500-line limit
- Follows cc10x-orchestration-safety protocol (edit-only, no new files)

## [6.0.7] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- **TDD Skill Enhancements** (386 → 470 lines)
  - **Coverage Threshold**: 80%+ coverage target for branches, functions, lines, statements
  - **Test Smells Table**: 8 anti-patterns with examples and fixes (testing implementation, dependent tests, mocking everything, giant setup, magic numbers, test name lies, no assertions, commented tests)
  - **Mocking Examples**: Common mock patterns for Supabase, Fetch/API, Redis, environment variables, and time

- **Debugging Patterns Enhancement** (399 → 436 lines)
  - **Build & Type Errors Quick Reference**: 9 common TypeScript/build error patterns with causes and fixes
  - **Minimal Diff Strategy**: Explicit guidance on fixing without over-engineering
  - **Build Error Priority Table**: CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM severity classification

- **Code Review Security Enhancement** (266 → 308 lines)
  - **Security Quick-Scan Commands**: 4 bash commands to detect hardcoded secrets, SQL injection risks, dangerous patterns, and console.log
  - **Critical Security Patterns Table**: 6 patterns with risk, detection, and fix guidance
  - **OWASP Top 10 Quick Reference**: Complete list for easy reference

### Notes

- All changes are SAFE edits to existing skills (no orchestration impact)
- Improvements extracted from `everything-claude-code` reference audit
- All files remain under 500-line limit
- Follows cc10x-orchestration-safety protocol (edit-only, no new files)

## [6.0.6] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- **Enhanced Frontend Patterns Skill** (582 lines, was 396)
  - Extracted best practices from Vercel Web Interface Guidelines, Anti-AI Slop SKILL, and UI/UX Pro Max
  - New sections:
    - **Design Thinking (Pre-Code)**: Purpose, Tone, Constraints, Differentiation framework
    - **Motion & Animation**: `prefers-reduced-motion`, compositor-friendly properties, timing rules
    - **Typography Rules**: Ellipsis, curly quotes, non-breaking spaces, `tabular-nums`, `text-wrap: balance`
    - **Content Overflow Handling**: `truncate`, `line-clamp`, `min-w-0` for flex children
    - **Form Best Practices**: `autocomplete`, `inputMode`, never block paste, spellcheck off
    - **Spatial Composition**: Asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow, grid-breaking, negative space
    - **Anti-patterns Blocklist**: 11 concrete items to flag with fixes
    - **Light/Dark Mode**: Contrast rules, opacity values, `color-scheme`, `theme-color`
    - **Performance Rules**: Virtualization, lazy loading, preconnect, font preload
    - **URL & State Management**: Deep-linking, query params for filters/tabs/pagination
    - **Touch & Mobile**: 44px targets, `touch-action`, `overscroll-behavior`, safe areas
  - Expanded Visual Creativity with icons (SVG only, no emoji), cursor, hover, backgrounds
  - Expanded Final Check with 5 additional verification items

### Changed

- **Frontend Patterns Skill** now covers comprehensive UI/UX guidelines from multiple industry sources
- Follows cc10x-orchestration-safety protocol (edit-only, no new files)

## [6.0.5] - 2026-01-31

### Changed

- **Ultra-Conservative Skill Cleanup**
  - Removed only 3 truly redundant sections (-41 lines total)
  - session-memory: Removed "The Bottom Line" (restates Iron Law)
  - planning-patterns: Removed "Remember" (repeats earlier content)
  - debugging-patterns: Removed "Real-World Impact" (statistics don't affect AI)

### Preserved

- All philosophical statements ("Violating the letter is violating the spirit")
- All "Why This Matters" sections (provide context for rules)
- All conceptual frameworks (Context Tiers, Quick Index, etc.)
- All Rationalization Prevention tables
- All Bible-mandated content (100%)

## [6.0.4] - 2026-01-31

### Added

- **Debug Attempt Tracking Format** (FLAW 8 Fix)
  - Explicit `[DEBUG-N]:` format for tracking debugging attempts in activeContext.md
  - Router counts lines matching `[DEBUG-N]:` pattern to trigger external research after 3+ failures
  - Bug-investigator documents required format with examples
  - Session-memory template includes format placeholder

### Changed

- **Router** (cc10x-router/SKILL.md:214-223)
  - Added "Debug Attempt Counting" section with format specification
  - Added "What counts as an attempt" clarification (hypothesis tested with code change, NOT reading/thinking)

- **Bug-Investigator** (bug-investigator.md:93-108)
  - Added "Debug Attempt Format (REQUIRED for DEBUG workflow)" section
  - Includes examples and explains why format is needed

- **Session-Memory** (session-memory/SKILL.md:381)
  - Added `[DEBUG-N]:` format to Recent Changes template

### Fixed

- **Research trigger undefined** (FLAW 8)
  - Root cause: "3+ local debugging attempts failed" had no defined format
  - Solution: `[DEBUG-N]: {what was tried} → {result}` format enables reliable counting

## [6.0.3] - 2026-01-31

### Added

- **Stable Anchor Registry** (session-memory)
  - Defined 7 guaranteed anchors: `## Recent Changes`, `## Learnings`, `## References`, `## Last Updated`, `## Common Gotchas`, `## Completed`, `## Verification`
  - Explicit guidance: NEVER use table headers or checkbox text as anchors

- **Read-Edit-Verify Pattern** (MANDATORY)
  - 4-step sequence: Read → Verify Anchor → Edit → Verify Change
  - Added to session-memory and all agent files
  - Prevents "Error editing file" by ensuring anchors exist before use

- **Extended Template Validation Gate** (Router)
  - Now validates all canonical sections in activeContext.md and progress.md
  - Auto-heals any missing sections using `## Last Updated` fallback

### Changed

- **activeContext.md Template** (12 → 8 sections)
  - Merged: `## Active Decisions` + `## Learnings This Session` → `## Decisions` + `## Learnings`
  - Merged: `## Plan Reference` + `## Design Reference` + `## Research References` → `## References`
  - Removed: `## User Preferences Discovered` (goes in Learnings)

- **progress.md Template** (8 → 5 sections)
  - Merged: `## Active Workflow Tasks` + `## In Progress` + `## Remaining` → `## Tasks`
  - Changed: `## Verification Evidence` table → `## Verification` bullets
  - Removed: `## Known Issues`, `## Evolution of Decisions`, `## Implementation Results`

- **Skills** (Table → Bullet Anchors)
  - github-research: Changed from table header to `## References` anchor
  - planning-patterns: Changed from `## Plan Reference` to `## References` anchor
  - brainstorming: Changed from `## Design Reference` to `## References` anchor

- **All Agents** (R-E-V Reminder)
  - Added "Memory Updates (Read-Edit-Verify)" section with stable anchors list
  - component-builder, bug-investigator, planner, integration-verifier, code-reviewer

### Fixed

- **"Error editing file" on Memory Operations**
  - Root cause: 14 different Edit anchors, many brittle (table headers, optional sections)
  - Solution: 7 stable anchors guaranteed to exist + Read-Edit-Verify pattern

### Notes

- Reduced anchor count from 14 to 7 (50% reduction)
- All table-header anchors eliminated
- Backward compatible: Template Validation Gate auto-heals old projects

## [6.0.2] - 2026-01-31

### Added

- **Template Validation Gate** (Router - Backward Compatibility Fix)
  - Router now auto-heals old projects by adding missing canonical sections
  - Checks for `## Plan Reference`, `## Design Reference`, `## Research References` after loading memory
  - If missing, inserts them before `## Last Updated` using a single Edit operation
  - Idempotent: runs once per project (subsequent sessions find sections present)

### Fixed

- **Silent Edit Failures on Old Projects**
  - v6.0.1 introduced targeted Edit anchors (e.g., `old_string="## Plan Reference"`)
  - Projects created before v6.0.1 lacked these sections, causing Edits to fail silently
  - Template Validation Gate ensures anchors exist before any skill tries to use them

### Notes

- This is a backward compatibility fix for projects migrating from pre-6.0.1 versions
- New projects are unaffected (templates already include canonical sections)

## [6.0.1] - 2026-01-31

### Added

- **Parallel-Safety Rules** (fixes FLAW 5 - memory race condition)
  - Router now instructs: "Avoid memory edits during parallel phases"
  - code-reviewer has explicit parallel-safety rule for BUILD workflow
  - Memory updates deferred to workflow-final checkpoint

- **Memory Update Targets** (all agents)
  - Each agent now has explicit guidance on which files/sections to update
  - Reduces ambiguity and prevents over-writing

- **Session Memory "Guts" Documentation**
  - Added "What Memory Actually Is" section explaining memory surfaces
  - Added Promotion Ladder (observation → pattern → artifact → evidence)
  - Added Ownership rules (who reads/writes)
  - Added Concurrency Rule for parallel phases

- **Canonical Sections in activeContext.md template**
  - `## Plan Reference` and `## Design Reference` now in template
  - Ensures Edit anchors exist for all new projects

### Changed

- **Agent Tools**
  - code-reviewer: `Write` → `Edit` (proper tool for memory updates)
  - integration-verifier: `Write` → `Edit`
  - planner: added `Edit` tool

- **Agent Modes**
  - code-reviewer: READ-ONLY for repo code (memory edits still allowed)
  - integration-verifier: READ-ONLY for repo code
  - planner: READ-ONLY for repo code (plan files + memory still writable)

- **Memory Loading**
  - All agents now read all 3 memory files (activeContext, patterns, progress)
  - Previously some agents only read 1-2 files

- **Edit Patterns**
  - brainstorming/planning-patterns: changed from whole-file replacement to small targeted edits
  - github-research: Edit anchor changed to table header row for stability

### Notes

- This release completes the FLAW 5 fix from the orchestration analysis
- Small targeted edits require canonical sections to exist (handled by updated templates)

## [6.0.0] - 2026-01-31

### Added

- **Tasks Contract Hardening (official-schema aligned)**
  - CC10X Tasks are now namespaced (subjects prefixed with `CC10X ...`) to prevent collisions and enable safer resumption.
  - Router notes official task-list sharing via `CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID` and treats TaskLists as potentially long-lived.

- **Task-Enforced Orchestration Gates (Flaw 4)**
  - Missing critical evidence now creates a `CC10X REM-EVIDENCE:` task and blocks downstream tasks via `addBlockedBy`.
  - Critical issues now create `CC10X REM-FIX:` tasks and block downstream tasks.
  - BUILD workflows enforce a **re-review loop after remediation** (re-run reviewer + hunter before integration verification).

### Changed

- Router + planning skills no longer rely on undocumented TaskCreate fields (e.g., `metadata`).
- Task examples standardized to canonical object-form calls (e.g., `TaskUpdate({ taskId: ..., status: \"...\" })`).

### Notes

- This release hardens orchestration reliability; it is intentionally strict to protect the system.

## [5.25.3] - 2026-01-30

### Added

- **Anti-Hardcode Gate** (bug-investigator)
  - Variant scan required before fixing (locale/config/roles/runtime/time/data/concurrency/network/cache)
  - Regression tests must cover at least one non-default variant when applicable

### Changed

- bug-investigator now **TDD-first** for DEBUG:
  - RED regression test before fix, GREEN after
  - Output requires TDD evidence + variant coverage summary
- Router validation requires bug-investigator TDD evidence + variant coverage before proceeding

### Notes

- No changes to task DAGs or workflow order
- Router change is validation-only (evidence gate)

## [5.25.2] - 2025-01-29

### Added

- **Iterative Retrieval Pattern** (stolen from Everything Claude Code)
  - Added to bug-investigator: Context Retrieval step for large codebase debugging
  - Added to planner: Context Retrieval step before designing features
  - Pattern: DISPATCH (broad) → EVALUATE (score 0-1) → REFINE (narrow) → LOOP (max 3)
  - Stop condition: 3+ files with relevance ≥0.7 AND no critical gaps

### Changed

- bug-investigator Process section: Steps renumbered (new step 3, old 3-8 → 4-9)
- planner Process section: Steps renumbered (new step 2, old 2-6 → 3-7)

### Notes

- Zero orchestration impact: Pure guidance content in SAFE zones
- No changes to: router, agent chains, output formats, task system

## [5.25.1] - 2025-01-29

### Added

- **Wiring Verification Patterns** (verification-before-completion skill)
  - Component → API check: grep patterns to verify fetch calls exist and response is used
  - API → Database check: grep patterns to verify queries exist and results are returned
  - Red flags table for common wiring stubs
  - Line count minimums by file type (Component: 15, API: 10, Hook: 10)

- **Hypothesis Quality Criteria** (debugging-patterns skill)
  - Falsifiability requirement: "A good hypothesis can be proven wrong"
  - Bad vs Good hypothesis examples (vague → specific)
  - Cognitive biases table: Confirmation, Anchoring, Availability, Sunk Cost with antidotes

### Changed

- Enhanced stub detection with GSD-inspired wiring verification patterns
- Enhanced debugging guidance with scientific hypothesis criteria

## [5.25.0] - 2025-01-29

### Added

  - component-builder checks prompt's Task Context for plan file path
  - No longer relies on inaccessible task metadata

- **Results Collection (FIX 2)**: New pattern for parallel agent output passing
  - Router collects code-reviewer + silent-failure-hunter findings
  - Passes merged findings to integration-verifier in prompt
  - Task system handles coordination, router handles content

- **Skill Loading Hierarchy (FIX 3)**: Documented 3-tier skill loading priority
  - Tier 1: Agent frontmatter `skills:` (automatic preload)
  - Tier 2: Router's SKILL_HINTS (mandatory, agent must load)
  - Tier 3: Agent's Skill Triggers (optional, agent judgment)

- **Enhanced Post-Agent Validation (FIX 4)**: Structured validation with required sections table
  - Per-agent required sections and evidence documented
  - Options: create remediation task OR ask user
  - Soft validation to avoid breaking workflows

### Changed

- **Silent Failure Hunter** - Enhanced `silent-failure-hunter.md` with active fixing
  - Changed from read-only to active fixer for CRITICAL silent failures
  - Empty catch blocks and silent failures fixed immediately, not deferred
  - HIGH/MEDIUM issues still create follow-up tasks

- **Rollback Strategy** - Added rollback decision tree to `integration-verifier.md`
  - Three explicit options when verification fails: Create Fix Task, Revert Branch, or Document & Continue
  - Prevents broken state from being left unaddressed

- **DEBUG Research Triggers** - Aligned DEBUG workflow research triggers in `cc10x-router/SKILL.md`
  - Added missing "3+ local debugging attempts failed" trigger
  - Now consistent with skill trigger table

### Removed

- **Router Post-Agent Validation** - Removed from `cc10x-router/SKILL.md`
  - Router is a one-shot starter, not a persistent orchestrator
  - Cannot validate agent outputs after invocation (architectural reality)
  - Agent self-discipline is the enforcement mechanism

### Changed

- **Agent Self-Enforcement Approach**: All agent improvements rely on self-discipline
  - Gates and checklists are for agents to follow, not router to enforce
  - Router starts workflow, agents are responsible for quality

## [5.24.0] - 2025-01-27

### Added

- **Research Documentation Persistence**: Research insights no longer lost after context compaction

  - Router creates task hierarchy with `TaskCreate` at workflow start
  - Agents call `TaskUpdate(status="completed")` when done
  - Dependencies managed via `blockedBy` for proper chain execution
  - `TaskList()` check at startup enables resume capability across sessions

## [5.18.0] - 2025-01-14

### Fixed

- **Two-Phase GitHub Research Enforcement**: Fixed critical issue where planner agent was ignoring SKILL_HINTS for github-research
  - Router now executes research FIRST using octocode tools directly (not as advisory hint)
  - Research results are passed to planner/bug-investigator in prompt
  - Research is now a PREREQUISITE, not a hint that can be skipped
  - Added RESEARCH_EXECUTED gate before planner when github-research detected

- **Explicit Research Request Trigger**: Added "research" to router triggers and explicit user request detection
  - Keywords: "research", "github", "octocode", "find on github", "how do others", "best practices"
  - Ensures router activates when user explicitly asks for GitHub research

### Changed

- **github-research Skill Simplified**: Reduced from ~201 lines to ~138 lines (31% smaller)
  - Removed duplicated octocode guidance (octocode MCP handles HOW)
  - Skill now focuses on WHEN to invoke and OUTPUT format for cc10x memory
  - Updated Iron Law: "NO EXTERNAL RESEARCH WITHOUT CLEAR AI KNOWLEDGE GAP OR EXPLICIT USER REQUEST"
  - Updated Integration Points to reflect Two-Phase execution model

- **cc10x-router Workflows**: Updated PLAN and DEBUG workflows
  - PLAN: Execute research FIRST, then invoke planner with results
  - DEBUG: Execute research FIRST for external service errors, then invoke bug-investigator

### Added

- **New SKILL_HINTS Detection Row**: Explicit user request detection for github-research
  - Pattern: User says "research", "github", "octocode", "find on github", "how do others", "best practices"
  - Agents: planner, bug-investigator

## [5.15.0] - 2025-01-11

### Added

  - Context Length Awareness: Recognize when sessions are getting long
  - Proactive Update Triggers: Update memory before auto-compact erases context
  - Checkpoint Pattern: Mid-session checkpoints for critical decisions
  - Red Flags table: Clear signals for when to update memory immediately

### Changed

- **session-memory Skill**: Added 146 lines of memory efficiency and safety guidance

## [5.14.0] - 2025-01-10

### Added

- **LSP Tool for All Agents**: Added Language Server Protocol (LSP) tool to all 6 agents
  - Enables go-to-definition, find-references, and hover documentation
  - Enhances code analysis capabilities for all workflows
  - Particularly valuable for bug-investigator (code path tracing) and code-reviewer (reference tracking)

- **Agent Context Isolation**: Added `context: fork` to all 6 agents
  - Each agent now runs in an isolated forked context
  - Prevents state leakage between agents in workflow chains
  - Improves reliability of parallel execution (code-reviewer ∥ silent-failure-hunter)

### Changed

- **All 6 Agents Updated**:
  - component-builder: Added LSP, context:fork
  - bug-investigator: Added LSP, context:fork
  - code-reviewer: Added LSP, context:fork
  - silent-failure-hunter: Added LSP, context:fork
  - integration-verifier: Added LSP, context:fork
  - planner: Added LSP, context:fork

### Compatibility

- Requires Claude Code v2.0.74+ for LSP tool support
- Requires Claude Code v2.1.0+ for `context: fork` feature
- Recommended: Claude Code v2.1.3+ for best experience

## [5.11.0] - 2025-01-06

### Fixed

- **Workflow Chain Enforcement**: Fixed critical issue where BUILD workflow stopped after component-builder
  - Root cause: Agent chains were documented but not enforced - Claude had no signal to continue
  - Added `WORKFLOW_CONTINUES` and `NEXT_AGENT` output signals to all agents
  - Added Chain Enforcement section to cc10x-router with explicit continuation rules
  - All 4 workflows now have complete chain coverage (BUILD, DEBUG, REVIEW, PLAN)

### Changed

- **component-builder**: Now outputs `NEXT_AGENT: code-reviewer` after completion
- **code-reviewer**: Context-aware - continues chain in BUILD/DEBUG, ends in REVIEW
- **silent-failure-hunter**: Now outputs `NEXT_AGENT: integration-verifier`
- **integration-verifier**: Outputs `WORKFLOW_CONTINUES: NO` to signal chain completion
- **bug-investigator**: Now outputs `NEXT_AGENT: code-reviewer` for DEBUG workflow
- **planner**: Outputs `WORKFLOW_CONTINUES: NO` (single-agent workflow)
- **cc10x-router**: Added Chain Enforcement section with explicit loop instructions

### Impact

- BUILD workflow now executes full chain: component-builder → [code-reviewer ∥ silent-failure-hunter] → integration-verifier
- DEBUG workflow now executes full chain: bug-investigator → code-reviewer → integration-verifier
- REVIEW and PLAN workflows properly signal completion
- Claude can no longer "forget" to invoke subsequent agents in the chain

## [5.8.1] - 2025-01-XX

### Fixed

- **Router Bypass Prevention**: Strengthened all agent and skill descriptions to explicitly prevent direct invocation
  - Added explicit router references to `integration-verifier` and `silent-failure-hunter` agents
  - Added router workflow context to `session-memory` and `verification-before-completion` skills
  - Enhanced router description as "THE ONLY ENTRY POINT FOR CC10X" with critical warning
  - All 17 components (6 agents + 11 skills) now explicitly prevent direct invocation
  - Production-ready protection against router bypass for millions of users

### Impact

- Zero ambiguity about router being the only entry point
- Explicit prevention of direct agent/skill invocation
- Consistent messaging across all components
- Memory flow integrity guaranteed (router loads memory first, updates last)

## [5.7.1] - 2025-12-21

### Fixed

- **silent-failure-hunter**: Added missing `verification-before-completion` skill
  - Agent audits error handling and reports findings
  - Now verifies findings before reporting (evidence-based)
  - All 5 code-touching agents now have verification skill

### Skill Loading Matrix (Updated)

| Agent | Auto-Loaded Skills |
|-------|-------------------|
| component-builder | session-memory, test-driven-development, code-generation, verification-before-completion |
| bug-investigator | session-memory, debugging-patterns, test-driven-development, verification-before-completion |
| code-reviewer | session-memory, code-review-patterns, verification-before-completion |
| integration-verifier | session-memory, architecture-patterns, debugging-patterns, verification-before-completion |
| silent-failure-hunter | session-memory, code-review-patterns, **verification-before-completion** ← ADDED |
| planner | session-memory, planning-patterns, architecture-patterns |

Note: planner doesn't need verification (creates plans, doesn't verify code)

## [5.7.0] - 2025-12-21

### Fixed

- **Agent Keyword Collision with Router**: Fixed critical issue where agent descriptions had same trigger keywords as cc10x-router, causing Claude to invoke agents directly instead of using workflows
  - **Same bug as v5.5.0 (skills) but for agents**
  - All 6 agents now say "Invoked by X workflow via cc10x-router. DO NOT invoke directly"
  - Removed workflow trigger keywords (build, debug, review, plan, etc.) from agent descriptions
  - Router is now the ONLY entry point - agents are only invoked BY workflows

### Root Cause

When user said "build a task tracker", Claude could match EITHER:
1. cc10x-router skill (keyword: "build") → Correct: Full workflow
2. component-builder agent (keyword: "build") → WRONG: Bypasses router

Claude sometimes picked the agent directly, bypassing:
- Memory loading
- User confirmation gates
- Agent chain (builder → reviewer → verifier)

### Fix Applied

Agents no longer have workflow trigger keywords. Only cc10x-router responds to:
`build, implement, create, make, write, add, develop, code, feature, component, app, application, review, audit, check, analyze, debug, fix, error, bug, broken, troubleshoot, plan, design, architect, roadmap, strategy`

### Agent Description Changes

| Agent | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| component-builder | "Triggers on build, create, implement..." | "Invoked by BUILD workflow. DO NOT invoke directly" |
| code-reviewer | "Triggers on review, audit, check..." | "Invoked by REVIEW workflow. DO NOT invoke directly" |
| bug-investigator | "Triggers on debug, fix, error, bug..." | "Invoked by DEBUG workflow. DO NOT invoke directly" |
| planner | "Triggers on plan, design, architect..." | "Invoked by PLAN workflow. DO NOT invoke directly" |
| integration-verifier | "Triggers on verify, validate..." | "Invoked by BUILD/DEBUG workflows. DO NOT invoke directly" |
| silent-failure-hunter | "Triggers on error handling, audit errors..." | "Invoked by BUILD/REVIEW workflows. DO NOT invoke directly" |

## [5.6.0] - 2025-12-21

### Fixed

- **Agent Tool Misconfiguration**: Fixed critical issue where agents were missing essential tools
  - **planner**: Was missing Write/Bash - couldn't save plans or run memory commands!
  - **silent-failure-hunter**: Was missing Write/Skill - couldn't update memory or load conditional skills!
  - **code-reviewer**: Was missing Write - couldn't update memory at end of review!
  - **integration-verifier**: Was missing Write - couldn't save verification results!
  - **component-builder**: Was missing Grep/Glob - couldn't search codebase for patterns!

### Changed

- All 6 agents now have consistent tool configuration:
  - **Builders** (component-builder, bug-investigator): Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob, Skill
  - **Analyzers** (code-reviewer, integration-verifier, planner, silent-failure-hunter): Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob, Skill
- Edit tool reserved for agents that modify code (builders)
- Write tool for all agents (needed for memory updates)
- Bash tool for all agents (needed for memory load command)

### Agent Tool Matrix

| Agent | Edit | Write | Bash | Grep | Glob | Skill |
|-------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|
| component-builder | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| bug-investigator | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| code-reviewer | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| integration-verifier | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| planner | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| silent-failure-hunter | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## [5.5.0] - 2025-12-20

### Fixed

- **Skill Keyword Conflicts**: Fixed critical issue where individual skills had same trigger keywords as router, causing Claude to match skills directly instead of using router
  - All 9 skills now say "Loaded by X agent. DO NOT invoke directly - use X workflow via cc10x-router"
  - Removed workflow trigger keywords (build, debug, review, plan, etc.) from individual skill descriptions
  - Router is now the ONLY entry point for workflow keywords

### Changed

- **test-driven-development**: Now loaded by component-builder agent only
- **code-generation**: Now loaded by component-builder agent only
- **debugging-patterns**: Now loaded by bug-investigator agent only
- **code-review-patterns**: Now loaded by code-reviewer agent only
- **planning-patterns**: Now loaded by planner agent only
- **brainstorming**: Now loaded by planner agent only
- **frontend-patterns**: Now loaded by code-reviewer agent (for UI code) only
- **architecture-patterns**: Now loaded by planner/code-reviewer agents only
- **verification-before-completion**: Now loaded by ALL agents automatically

### Root Cause

In v5.4.0, when user said "build a task tracker", Claude matched BOTH:
1. cc10x-router (keyword: "build")
2. test-driven-development skill (keyword: "build")

Claude picked the individual skill instead of the router, bypassing workflow orchestration.

### Fix Applied

Skills no longer have workflow trigger keywords. Only cc10x-router responds to:
`build, implement, create, make, write, add, develop, code, feature, component, app, application, review, audit, check, analyze, debug, fix, error, bug, broken, troubleshoot, plan, design, architect, roadmap, strategy`

## [5.4.0] - 2025-12-20

### Fixed

- **Router Auto-Execute Enforcement**: Fixed critical issue where Claude would list cc10x capabilities instead of executing workflows
  - Changed description from passive "should be used" to aggressive "AUTO-LOAD AND EXECUTE"
  - Added "What NOT To Do" section explicitly forbidding capability listing
  - Added 3 execution examples showing the RIGHT way to respond
  - Router now triggers on expanded keywords: app, application, feature, component, develop, code

### Changed

- **Router Title**: Changed from "Simple Workflow Coordination" to "Workflow Execution Engine"
- **Router Behavior**: Now explicitly states "THIS IS AN EXECUTION ENGINE, NOT DOCUMENTATION"
- **Plugin Description**: Updated to emphasize "AUTO-EXECUTE routing (not just describe capabilities)"

### Key Behavior Change

**Before v5.4.0** (WRONG):
```
user: "build a task tracker"
assistant: "cc10x has these capabilities: brainstorming, planning, building..."
```

**After v5.4.0** (CORRECT):
```
user: "build a task tracker"
assistant: "Detected BUILD intent. Executing BUILD workflow.
Loading memory...
Clarifying requirements:
1. What framework?
2. What features?
..."
```

## [5.3.0] - 2025-12-20

  - Reduces false positives and improves signal-to-noise ratio
  - Self-check questions before reporting any issue
  - Output format includes confidence scores

- **User Confirmation Gates**: BUILD workflow now REQUIRES user confirmation before implementing
  - Phase 1 "CLARIFY REQUIREMENTS" marked as "CRITICAL: DO NOT SKIP"
  - Must present questions to user and wait for answers
  - If user says "whatever you think", state recommendation and get confirmation

- **Git History Context**: code-reviewer checks git blame and recent commits
  - Run `git log --oneline -10 -- <file>` for recent changes
  - Run `git blame <file>` for authorship context
  - Check if similar issues were fixed before
  - Output format includes Git Context section

- **Silent Failure Hunter**: New specialized agent for error handling audits
  - Triggers on "error handling", "audit errors", "catch blocks", "silent failures"
  - Zero tolerance for empty catch blocks, log-only catches, generic error messages
  - Integrated into BUILD workflow (after code-reviewer, if error handling code)
  - Severity rating: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW

### Changed

- BUILD workflow: Added clarification step and silent-failure-hunter
- REVIEW workflow: Can now invoke silent-failure-hunter for error handling focus
- code-reviewer output format: Now includes confidence scores and git context
- Intent Detection: Added "error handling, audit errors, catch blocks, silent failures" routing
